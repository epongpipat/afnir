Description: Wrapper functions that interface with 'AFNI' (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni),
    a powerful and commonly-used 'neuroimaging'
    software, using system commands. The goal is to be able to interface with 'AFNI'
    completely in R, where you pass R objects of class 'nifti', implemented by
    package 'oro.nifti', and the function executes an 'AFNI' command and returns an R
    object of class 'nifti' if desired.
